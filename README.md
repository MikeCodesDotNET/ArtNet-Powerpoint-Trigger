ArtNet-Powerpoint-Trigger
=========================

####Please test before using

This project was thrown together a number of years ago and worked for the show it was produced for. It has not been looked at or improved since.


I developed this plugin in a lunch break for a colleague who needed to control a PowerPoint presentation from an ETC Ion. 

###Releasing
I would have improved the project to be a valuable project but because if the requirement to sign PowerPoint plugins I have chosen to let this die. 

It might be of use to you for your show but you will need to build the solution on the machine its needed on. 

Visual Studio Express Should* be capable of building the solution though I only tested with Visual Studio Professional 2010. 

###Problems
If you hit any problems then feel free to ping me a message letting me know. I probably won't be doing much with this project any more but can help you if you want to get stuck in.
